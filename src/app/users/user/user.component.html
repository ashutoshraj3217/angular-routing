<p>User with ID {{ user.id }} loaded.</p>
<p>User name is {{ user.name }}</p>

<!-- If currently we are currently on the same route, then (this.route.snapshot.params['id']) wouldn't work bcoz angular wont rerender the component to avoid the performance issues -->
<a [routerLink]="['/users', 22, 'David']">Load David</a> 
<!-- So we will have to use params observable(i.e, this.route.params.subscribe())-->
